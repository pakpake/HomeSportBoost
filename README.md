In this repository, you'll also find a powerpoint presentation, with our notes.

The instructions are as follows:


    You have to implement a user-centered design to conceive an original and innovative 
    interactive system by following the steps bellow :
    * Exploration: phase of understanding the needs, motivations, cultures of the users
    * Ideation: phase of emergence of possible solutions
    * Generation: prototype design phase
    * Evaluation: phase of internal testing of the prototype

    For exploration, you can use a focus group among yourselves.

    For the ideation, you will brainstorm, you will define a persona and an associated scenario.

    For the generation, you will create wireframe prototypes.

    For the evaluation, you will use the ergonomic criteria of Bastien & Scapin.
